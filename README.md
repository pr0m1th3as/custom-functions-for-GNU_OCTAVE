# custom-functions-for-GNU_OCTAVE
A repo with customized functions for GNU OCTAVE offering new functionality or enhanced features over existing functions available in the forge packages.

The functions available here have been developed for personal academic research, but they are made available for everyone to enjoy the increased capabilities and perhaps benefit for their own works, provide feedback about their functionality and report possible bugs, and in the hope that they might become adopted in future releases of related forge packages.
